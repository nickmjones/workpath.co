          <p>
            This site ("Site") is created and operated by Workpath, Inc., a Delaware
            company with offices in Richmond, Virginia, formerly known as Iggbo,
            Inc. ("Workpath," “we,” or “us”). When you use the service(s) provided
            and offered on the Site (the "Services"), you are agreeing to these
            Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) between you and Workpath.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workpath has developed a platform (“Platform”) that (i) allows clients
            of Workpath (collectively, “Clients”) to access to their labor pool
            (“Specialists”) for the provision of services to or for the benefit of
            customer or patients and each Client, (ii) allows Clients to create
            appointment requests for the performance and delivery of services
            (“Requested Services”) by Specialists, including the service provider,
            that have registered through the Platform to provide Requested Services,
            (iii) allows Specialists to access appointment requests for Requested
            Services, (iv) allows Specialists to accept appointments for Requested
            Services, and (v) facilitates scheduling the performance of Requested
            Services by Specialists, provides appointment reminders, and provides
            for the payment of Specialists for such services. Workpath service
            agreements with Clients are typically annual contracts, and the payment
            and term of such agreements are binding on Client. Specialists are
            engaged by Client, at Client’s option, on Client’s terms. Specialists
            are not interviewed, vetted, selected, approved, contracted, or hired by
            Workpath.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workpath has the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add or
            remove certain of these terms of these Terms at any time. The
            then-current version of these Terms will govern your interactions with
            the Site and the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may change or discontinue any aspect of the Site or the Services at
            any time, including the availability of any feature, function, or
            content. We may limit features and Services or restrict your access to
            parts or all of the Site or the Services provided without notice or
            liability.
          </p>

          <h5>WORKPATH ACCOUNT</h5>
          <p>
            Your Workpath account gives you access to the Services and functionality
            that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole
            discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different
            types of users. If you open a Workpath account on behalf of a company,
            organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that
            entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized
            representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to
            these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.
            By connecting to Workpath with a third-party service, you give us
            permission to access and use your information from that service as
            permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that
            service.

          <p>
            You may never use another user’s account without permission. When
            creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete
            information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are
            solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you
            must keep your account password secure and not share it with others. We
            encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a
            combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with
            your account. You must notify Workpath immediately of any breach of
            security or unauthorized use of your account. Workpath will not be
            liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

            indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, including for
            any lost profits or lost data, that result from the use of, or the
            inability to use, the Platform, unauthorized access to or alteration of
            your transmissions or data, or any errors or omissions in the
            information presented by the Platform, even if Workpath is aware or has
            been advised of the possibility of such damages. You specifically
            acknowledge and agree that Workpath is not liable for any conduct of any
            user.

          <p>
            Certain state laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the
            exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you,
            some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not
            apply to you, and you may have additional rights. If you are
            dissatisfied or harmed by Workpath's services, the actions or failures
            of any Specialist, any other Site user, any Workpath partner, third
            party, any Workpath material, or with any of Workpath's terms and
            conditions, your remedy is limited to your decision to discontinue using
            the Site, together with the return to you of any net payment or profit
            received by Workpath directly in connection with the facts of your
            claim. You agree that Workpath shall not be liable to you or to any
            third parties for any actions or failures of any Specialist, any other

          <h5>RELATIONSHIP WITH SPECIALISTS</h5>
          <p>
            The Platform exists to help you manage your Specialists and their
            assignments and performance. You acknowledge and agree that this is the
            limitation of the role of Workpath and the Platform to you. Specialists
            are not employees, subcontractors, officers, or agents of Workpath, and
            Workpath is not responsible for Specialists’ actions or failures to act.
            When you work with a Specialist, your rights will be governed by and
            limited to your agreement with that Specialist. Specialists will
            typically interact with the Platform and Service by means of a mobile
            app, under terms and conditions that apply to such mobile app. Those
            terms are available for your review <a href="/mobileterms">here</a> and
            are incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions.

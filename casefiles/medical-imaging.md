##### Challenge

Roshal Imaging Services is a national provider of scheduled and on-demand ultrasound services to healthcare facilities. They guarantee an imaging technologist will be on-site in 60 minutes or less--24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Before implementing Workpath, Roshal Imaging Services relied on call trees and a call center staff to manage order intake, technologist qualification and identification, and dispatch for hundreds of appointments daily.

##### Workpath's solution

With Workpath and Siemens Healthineers’ CrewPlace&trade; platform, Roshal Imaging Services now receives orders electronically, has automated their labor selection process, and dispatches technologists in less than a minute from order creation without call center staff intervention.

Building on this success, Siemens Healthineers leverages Workpath to provide their partner hospitals and healthcare facilities with on-demand visibility into their technologist staffing and allows facilities to easily expand their labor pool by tapping into the Siemens Healthineers network of imaging technologists and sonographers.

Using Workpath’s customized dashboard, Siemens Healthineers can also provide real-time reporting on imaging technologist work status, utilization, service volume, and other insights that are not available through traditional scheduling or dispatch solutions.

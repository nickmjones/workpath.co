##### Challenge

Before Workpath, one major reference laboratory performed phlebotomy (blood draws) in service centers where patients would arrive, wait in a queue, sometimes for hours, to eventually meet with a phlebotomist and get blood drawn. This inconvenient experience caused high levels of patient dissatisfaction and, in some cases, led to patients not following through with physician-ordered blood work; resulting in lost revenue.

To provide the patients with an alternative experience to getting drawn in a service center, the reference laboratory decided to implement a mobile phlebotomy program for their patients. This enabled patients to receive blood work in the location of their choice, like their home or workplace, with the goal of providing a more convenient experience.

##### Workpath's solution

With Workpath, the reference laboratory, within a matter of weeks, implemented a mobile phlebotomy program with automated physician order intake from EHRs to reduce duplication of orders by a physician; patient self-scheduling to give patients flexibility, phlebotomist dispatching to remove out-dated workflows, and optimized phlebotomist routing and tracking throughout the job to remove manual communication.

Patients easily enter their address and pick the date and time for their appointment via a link sent via SMS or email. They then receive automated communication throughout the appointment lifecycle, including a link to track the phlebotomistâ€™s location en route and expected arrival time.
